<p><h1> Mandala Flower:</h1></p>

<p><b> I made this project by using the shoes in Photoshop and rotating them constantly to make patterns. First I chose the shape I wanted, which was a flower. After I duplicated the pages and made the image smaller and changed the color and centered it then rotated it and combined it. Lastly I repeated the steps until I made a spiral. I used a beautiful flower and the colors I used were dark blue and light green. What I notice happen is the shapes kept duplicating and shifting the shapes everywhere. &nbsp; </b></p>
<p><h1>Filters & Adjustments Transformation:</h1></p>

<p><b> We made this project by using photoshop and turning a picture into a really creative artwork. First what I did was choose an image that I preferred. Then edit it by rotating it to make it look like a pattern. After that, combine it to make it look like a repeated pattern on it and it goes from a simple image to looks like a unique pattern as a rug/mat. The original photo was making copies and rotating them and adding them together to make this unique pattern.</b></p>
<p><h1>Pixel Character:</h1></p>

<p><b>I used the tools by coloring them differently to make a specific character when zoomed out. I started byt making the character first before the background which is the third mario brother. My character looks like a darker version of the Mario Bros but a whole set of different features. My character is wearing a plumber's hat that is blue with a blue t-shirt and gray overalls and white gloves. My character would be another version of Mario but where he is the hero saving his brothers from Bowser. The purpose would be to complete every level and get steps closer to save his brothers.</b></p>
<p><h1>Fantastic Beasts:</h1></p>

<p><b>I created the mystical creature by combining animals together with edits. The animal abilities added are a tiger's body, a giraffeâ€™s neck and an elephant's head. By making this I started choosing the pictures of the animals I want. Then take out the background and leave the animal parts and add them all together.</b></p>
<p><h1>Pop Art Celebrities:</h1></p>
<img src="Neymar.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""/>
<p><b>When I did the portrait of neymar by changing the color I had to press Command U to change the colors for everything to make it all look different. I used the crop tool to make the picture more of a square shape evenly into four sections of different colors. As well as the move tools to make the four images move into a seperate corner. In this mini unit I used my own selfie to do the project because to show my face and how it looks every day. The emotion that it is showing is happiness because I have so much self love and am not ashamed of myself.
